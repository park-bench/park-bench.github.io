	  <h3>Motivation</h3>
	    <div class="motivationContainer">
		  <p id="itemmone" class="aboutPage">The <a class="basicLink" href="https://freedom.press/" target="_blank">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a> has done a good job of creating a secure reporting 
	      tool for anonymous whistleblowers and informants, but good software security is not worth much if there 
	      is insufficient physical security. Fortunately most <a class="basicLink" href="https://securedrop.org/" target="_blank">SecureDrop</a> instances exist in the server rooms of 
	      big multimedia news corporations that (hopefully) already have good physical security. But what do you 
	      do if you are not a big news corporation and want to run a SecureDrop instance? That's where Parkbench 
	      can help.</p>
 	    
		  <p id="itemmtwo" class="aboutPage">When you are running a SecureDrop instance, you want to be notified if your SecureDrop website stops 
	      working and you want to be notified if someone is trying physically access your SecureDrop servers. This 
	      software, along with a custom built server cabinet, can make it very hard for someone to take down or 
	      physically access your SecureDrop instance without you knowing about it.</p>
          
          <p id="itemmthree" class="aboutPage">We initially developed these applications with the intention of providing better physical security 
	      for our own SecureDrop instance. However we eventually elected to cancel the SecureDrop portion of our 
	      project and to only focus on developing the supporting monitoring and intrusion detection software.</p>

          <p id="itemmfour" class="aboutPage">Parkbench is not affiliated with SecureDrop or the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</p>
