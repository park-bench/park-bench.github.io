	<h1>How it Works</h1>
	  <h2>Build/Install Instructions</h2>
	  <div class="containerbuild">
	    <p class="setupPage">Each package can be built in any order, but Confighelper must be installed
        first, Gpgmailer must be installed second, and then batwatch, netcheck, torwatchdog, and watchman
        may be installed in any order. Each of these projects has specific
        build instructions on their respective project pages.</p>
   	  </div>
	
	<h2>Server Monitoring</h2>
	  <div class="containersetup1">
        <p class="setupPage">It is important to know if your SecureDrop instance stops running. torwatchdog and 
		gpgmailer can be used together to provide you with encrypted email notifications if your 
		SecureDrop instance goes down. It is recommended that you install this monitoring software 
		on several geographically diverse computers to make it harder for adversaries effectively 
	    disable it.</p>
	  </div>
	  
    <h2>Cabinet Setup</h2>
  	  <div class="containersetup1">
        <p class="setupPage">When we still intended to actually create a SecureDrop instance, we created a custom 
		server cabinet to house our SecureDrop servers. For the cabinet, we used a steal lockable 
		cabinet and drilled holes (with a hole saw) so that the servers could get access to electricity 
		and wired Ethernet. On the doors of the cabinet, we attached a staple safety hasp which allowed 
		us to lock the cabinet with a high security padlock.</p>
	  </div>

         
          <h3 class="cabinet">The cabinet was intended to store the following</h3>
	      <div class="containercab">
		    <div id="cabinetItemOne">
              <img class="cabinetpic" src="site_images/IMG_0847.jpg" alt="Cabinet shelf the server">
            </div>
			<ul id="cabinetItemTwo">
		      <li class="list c1">The SecureDrop Application Server</li>
              <li class="list c2">The SecureDrop Monitor Server</li>
              <li class="list c1">A pfSense Network Firewall integrated with or connected to a switch</li>
              <li class="list c2">A WiFi capable third server for Parkbench monitoring software</li>
              <li class="list c1">The Secure Viewing Station laptop when not in use</li>
              <li class="list c2">Several other secure laptops to be used for system administration</li>
              <li class="list c1">Multiple USB cellular hotspots for maintaining a connection to the Internet</li>
              <li class="list c2">A USB webcam for filming intruders</li>
              <li class="list c1">Lighting to improve images of intruders</li>
              <li class="list c2">A large uninterruptible power supply</li>
              <li class="list c1">Other things we wanted to keep secure such as extra lock keys</li>
            </ul> 
          </div>	
	  <div class="conatinerIn">
        <h2>Intrusion Detection</h2>
          <p class="setupPage">It is critical for any SecureDrop instance to have excellent physical security. batwatch,
                  netcheck, gpgmailer, watchman, and a custom server cabinet can be used together to make it extremely 
		  difficult for someone to gain physical access to SecureDrop servers and go undetected.</p>
		  <h3>Internet Connection Redundancy</h3>
          
		    <p class="setupPage">Many security systems can be foiled by simply cutting off their connection the Internet. 
		    Technically speaking, Parkbench is no different. However, what makes the Parkbench intrusion 
		    detection system special is that it supports any number of backup Internet connections and is 
		    designed to cycle through them quickly. Any Internet connection supported by Ubuntu's Network 
		    Manager is supported.</p> 
	  
		  
          
		      <p class="setupPage">The SecureDrop Application Server and SecureDrop Monitor are simply plugged into the 
		      pfSense firewall switch. The Parkbench monitoring server should be plugged into the pfSense 
		      firewall switch, the camera, and the USB hot spots. Of course, the secure viewing station 
		      should never be plugged into anything but power.</p>
              
			  <img id="webcampic" src="site_images/webcampic.png" alt="webcam" />
		      <p class="setupPage">Within the cabinet, we attached the USB webcam to the top of the cabinet and positioned 
		      the camera so that it would be pointing at the head of the person opening the cabinet. We 
		      added permanent lighting in the cabinet to better light any potential intruder. To make the 
		      cabinet less conspicuous, we affixed the loop side of hook and loop tape to the inside of the 
		      seams of the cabinet doors. This stopped most of the light from being visible from outside of 
		      the cabinet when it was closed.</p>
			  <div class=" plugimages plugpics">
                <img  class="plugimages" id="plugPic" src="site_images/cameraPlug.png" alt="web cam USB cord" />
		        <br>
				<img class="plugimages" id="plugPic2" src="site_images/cameraPlug2.png" alt="web cam USB cord with door closed" />
			  </div>
			  <p class="setupPage">The watchman camera software is specifically programmed to allow for the user to plug and
		      unplug the USB camera at will. This allows for the camera to be easily temporarily disabled 
		      so that an adversary cannot discretely use it to their advantage. To help ensure the camera 
		      is plugged back in before the cabinet is locked, we clip the USB-A end of the camera to the 
		      outside of the cabinet. This way, if we try to close the cabinet without plugging camera back 
		      in, the cabinet door will not shut.</p>

          <h3>Webcam Microphones</h3>
		  <div class="container">
            <p class="setupPage">Most USB Webcams today have an integrated microphone. We recommend disabling this 
			microphone so that an adversary cannot use it to their advantage. Unfortunately, simply 
			removing the webcam microphone will likely render the webcam completely inoperative. 
			However, from our experience, if you simply bridge the solder points where the microphone 
			should be, the camera will work as expected.</p> 
          </div>

          <h3>Uninterruptable Power</h3>
             <p class="setupPage">All powered devices should be plugged into an uninterruptable power supply (UPS).
               The UPS should be sufficient to provide power for several hours after main power is lost. If the UPS
               completely drains and nobody is available to physically monitor the servers, one must assume the
               servers are compromised.</p>
             <p class="setupPage">The UPS should support a communications link for power status notifications. The
               communications link should be connected to the Parkbench server where batwatch is installed.</p>
		
          <h3>Side Channel Attacks</h3>
            <p class="setupPage">It is important to note that this setup might be vulnerable to several side channel 
			attacks:</p>
            <div class="containerSide">
              <img class="powerButton" src="site_images/powerIconTwo.png" alt="power icon">
  			  <p class="setupPage setupPageTwo">Power monitoring attack</p>
     	      
			  <img class="lightning" src="site_images/lightning.png" alt="lighting bolt icon">
              <p class="setupPage setupPageTwo">Electromagnetic attack</p>
			  
              <img class="sound" src="site_images/soundFive.png" alt="sound icon">
			  <p class="setupPage setupPageTwo">Acoustic attack</p>
		    </div>
			<p class="setupPage">When we were still committed to implementing a SecureDrop instance, we were going to 
			attempt to mitigate these attacks. We had acquired a power line conditioner to attempt to
			mitigate the power monitoring attack. To mitigate the acoustic attack, we planned to write 
			a small computer program to produce low volume static from the Parkbench monitoring server's
			speakers. To mitigate the electromagnetic attack, we were going to try to attach metal 
			screening to the insides of the cabinet.</p>

            <p class="setupPage">I cannot say for certain if any of these mitigation measures would have worked. If you 
			decide to implement these mitigations, please do your own research and thoroughly test 
			them.</p>
