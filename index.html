        <h1>Organization Description</h1>

        <p>This is a collection of software built as a support system for a SecureDrop
        instance. It contains four primary components: </p>

        <ul>
        <li>gpgmailer sends encrypted email</li>
        <li>torwatchdog discreetly monitors the status of a hidden service</li>
        <li>watchman monitors a physical location with a camera</li>
        <li>netcheck attempts to keep Internet access</li>
        </ul>

        <p>torwatchdog, watchman, and netcheck can all be used independently of each
        other, but require gpgmailer.</p>

        <p>These programs are still in development and may not be production-ready.
        However, if you do use our software, please let us know. Any feedback is
        extremely helpful.</p>

        <h1>Motivation</h1>

        <p>We initially developed these applications while planning a local SecureDrop
        instance, but chose to only continue developing the supporting monitoring
        software.</p>

        <h1>Detailed Descriptions</h1>

        <h2>Gpgmailer</h2>

        <p>Gpgmailer is a daemon that sends encrypted email and includes a Python library
        to add messages to its' queue.  The Python library, gpgmailqueue, accepts a
        subject, body, and an arbitrary number of attachments, then writes the
        unencrypted message to a file defined in the configuration file. The daemon
        reads the file, builds the email, signs, encrypts, and sends a
        properly-formatted PGP/MIME email to each configured recipient.</p>

        <h2>Torwatchdog</h2>

        <p>Torwatchdog is a relatively simple URL checking daemon that uses Tor and times
        each request randomly. It starts its own Tor instance and randomly selects from
        a specified list of nameservers. When the daemon detects a state change, either
        up or down, it sends an encrypted email notification via Gpgmailer.</p>

        <h2>Watchman</h2>

        <p>Watchman is a daemon that monitors a camera for motion and responds by taking
        several pictures. Those pictures are then sent in an encrypted email via
        Gpgmailer. It detects and properly ignores background changes.</p>

        <h2>Netcheck</h2>

        <p>Netcheck is a daemon that attempts to keep a working Internet connection at all
        times. It first checks the wired network for an address and for DNS capability.
        If that fails, it does the same with the backup wifi network, and if that
        fails, it checks a list of supplemental wifi networks. If all of that fails, it
        just keeps trying.</p>

        <h2>Confighelper</h2>

        <p>Confighelper is a class with a collection of helper methods for parsing
        configuration files, performing very basic value-checking, and setting up
        logging in a particular way. All of our projects depend on this library.</p>

        <h1>Build/Install Instructions</h1>

        <p>Each package can be built in any order, but Confighelper must be installed
        first, Gpgmailer must be installed second, and then Torwatchdog, Watchman, and
        Netcheck may be installed in any order. Each of these projects has specific
        build instructions on their respective project pages.</p>

        <h1>Contact</h1>

        <p>We would love to know if you are using any of our projects! Even one user is a
        strong motivator for us, so please contact us with any questions or comments,
        either through Github or email.</p>
